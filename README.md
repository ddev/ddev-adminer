# DDEV Adminer Service

## What is this?

This repository allows you to quickly install Adminer database manager into a [Ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) project using just `ddev get drud/ddev-adminer`.

Adminer is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. This service
currently ships the [official adminer container](https://hub.docker.com/_/adminer)
with no _external_ plugins. It contains all official plugins and themes and allows
to easily chose one by editing the `docker-compose.adminer.yaml` file after
installation.

This currently supports:

* MySQL / MariaDB
* PostgreSQL

## Installation

* `ddev get drud/ddev-adminer && ddev restart`

Then you can just `ddev launcha -a` or use `ddev describe` to get the URL (`https://<project>.ddev.site:9101`).

## What does this add-on do?

* Adds the adminer container as a service
* Adds a `ddev launcha` command at the project level with a `ddev launcha -a` (or `ddev launcha --adminer`) option to launch you right into adminer.
